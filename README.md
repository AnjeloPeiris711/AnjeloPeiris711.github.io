> How to Install Nessus in wsl(26/09/2022)

if you  trying to install nessus for a vulnerability study in Kali linux. Kali is running as a Win-Kex instance from WSL2 on windows 11. I have downloaded Nessus and trying to install with:

```python
~/rootðŸ’€junior# sudo dpkg -i Nessus-10.3.0-debian6_amd64.deb
```

But you are getting error as ...

```python
~/rootðŸ’€junior# System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate
```
I guess this is because WSL2 doesn't actually "boot up" Linux, instead Linux behaves like a docker container without any kind of init system.The easiest way to install is as a docker image.

So you can try this

```python
~/rootðŸ’€junior# docker pull tenableofficial/nessus
```

After that

```python
~/rootðŸ’€junior# docker run -d --name tenableofficial_nessus -p 8834:8834 tenableofficial/nessus
```
And thatâ€™s it! Now the container should be running and we can open https://localhost:8834/ and activate our new shiny Nessus instance.

You might have started facing this problem either after updating your CRA or starting a new project using create-react-app which lead to the probable lead cause of it to be react-error-overlay.

So try this ```npm i -D react-error-overlay@6.0.9```

>What the hell is this saying? ```Access to fetch at from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy```

I don't have a deep understanding of this but the reason to face this issue is because of making "API" requests with the same domain name.So i enable CORS in flask

``` pip install -U flask-cors ```
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, url_for, request
from flask_cors import CORS, cross_origin
app = Flask(__name__)
cors = CORS(app)
app.config['CORS_HEADERS'] = 'Content-Type'
@app.route("/members",methods=["GET"])
@cross_origin()
def members():
    return{
        "members":[
            "Member1",
            "Member2",
            "Member3"
        ]
    }
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
