> How to Install Nessus in wsl(26/09/2022)

if you  trying to install nessus for a vulnerability study in Kali linux. Kali is running as a Win-Kex instance from WSL2 on windows 11. I have downloaded Nessus and trying to install with:

```python
~/rootðŸ’€junior# sudo dpkg -i Nessus-10.3.0-debian6_amd64.deb
```

But you are getting error as ...

```python
~/rootðŸ’€junior# System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate
```
I guess this is because WSL2 doesn't actually "boot up" Linux, instead Linux behaves like a docker container without any kind of init system.The easiest way to install is as a docker image.

So you can try this

```python
~/rootðŸ’€junior# docker pull tenableofficial/nessus
```

After that

```python
~/rootðŸ’€junior# docker run -d --name tenableofficial_nessus -p 8834:8834 tenableofficial/nessus
```
And thatâ€™s it! Now the container should be running and we can open https://localhost:8834/ and activate our new shiny Nessus instance.
